    <h3> 1. Surveillance </h3>
    <p>Surveillance is used in investigations for fraud as a practice of tracking suspicious activity. It is the most effective method of fastening a business’ security and determining the roots of its fraudulent claims. A considerable benefit of allowing a private investigation agency to direct the surveillance in a business is the level of professional training that their investigators have received. These highly qualified individuals are not only able to gather evidence that tends to stand out in court, but are also capable of doing so without being detected.  A wide range of approaches can be taken to implement surveillance in the workplace. Common methods generally involve the use of electronic and/or physical observance and are known to be the most efficient in gathering significant data about suspect behaviour. </p>

    <p>An essential procedure that can be implemented in the recruitment phase to prevent fraud in its entirety is the conduction of background checks.Thorough background checks go far beyond simply analyzing a potential candidate’s criminal record. You want to be certain that you hire someone who can thrive in their role. Thus, private investigators are often hired to conduct preliminary research on potential candidates looking to join a business. A certified private investigator is knowledgeable of the specificities he/she needs to seek and is able to properly verify an applicant's personal history without posing any violations. By conducting comprehensive background checks, businesses can ensure that their team is filled with individuals that are presumably less likely to pose a threat to their company. </p>

    <p>Undercover investigations are generally unnecessary in most cases of fraud. However, when they are required, allowing private investigation agencies to mediate these operations is always the most desirable option. These types of investigations are broadly utilized under strict circumstances where businesses encounter any large, unexpected losses (i.e. inventory loss). Attempting to unravel what triggered these situations is made possible primarily through the use of undercover operations, where specially trained private investigators are able to mask their identity (to avoid detection) in an effort to observe the suspicious activity of those accused/suspected.  </p>
